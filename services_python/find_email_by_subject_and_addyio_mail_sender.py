# This function will find email by specified subject and specified addyio unique email
# We give this function a dictionary containing all emails with a specified subject.
# then we loop through that dictionary finding the anonaddy domain email we want.
# Then we return that specified email :D
# If there are 2 of them we return the one with the most recent date.


# <rg0z23it+admin=uber.com@anonaddy.me> We can find the addy.io email domain by removing
# <> brackets and everything before the + then adding @anonaddy.me !
