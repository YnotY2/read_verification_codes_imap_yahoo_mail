# Fetch verification emails from mail inbox using IMAP protocol.

Okay so basically this code is a template that can be modified to easily
read email from within the yahoo mail account specified using very simply
credentials:
-app password yahoo
-yahoo mail account name

This is entirely free to use!

I will check for the email containing the verification code from the
"inbox" and from the "Spam" folders.

I can then check if the body of either most recent emails A or B contains
the text aka re pattern I am looking for indicating the promotion company
/service I am trying to harvest.

Then I can extract the verification code from that email using another
custom re pattern.


So basically for each new service I only need to modify the re pattern
for the mail it's self. This way I can use this code across multiple
services I want to extract the verification code for :D
